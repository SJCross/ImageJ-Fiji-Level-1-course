ImageJ/Fiji Level 1 course
==========================

Materials for the "ImageJ/Fiji Level 1: Basics of image processing and analysis" course taught at the Wolfson Bioimaging Facility, University of Bristol.

This workshop is suitable for anyone acquiring microscopy data as part of their research. No prior knowledge is necessary or assumed. The practical components are designed to enable attendees to work at their own pace.

The workshop begins with a presentation introducing fundamental concepts of image analysis, characteristics of image data, its processing and segmentation. The attendees then learn how to use ImageJ/Fiji to analyse features in microscopy images by carrying out a series of hands-on exercises using provided images.

The examples used concentrate on fluorescence microscopy but the techniques used are widely applicable to other types of images.

Training is provided by staff from the Wolfson Bioimaging Facility during the hands on session which covers importing and exploring images, pre-processing data, object segmentation and finally, an introduction to macro recording and batch analysis.
